# MEAN-stack-boilerplate
A simple MEAN stack bilerplate that includes frontend and backend. In this project I use Angular/NodeJs/Express/Sequelize/Mysql. Feel free to contribute. This is a work in progress and I created it to learn the MEAN stack(Without MongoDB) please be aware that I am a junior.
